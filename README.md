# VulIDE (crabtui)

A terminal UI for the [Vulpin](https://github.com/vulpin-lang/Vulpin) language —
editor, syntax highlighting, autocomplete, find/replace, a structure outline, an
undefined-variable linter, and a run console, all keyboard-first with an optional
mouse layer.

This is the **Rust track** of the VulIDE rewrite (the original is a PyQt5 desktop
app). It's built on [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs) and is pure Rust — no C
toolchain, no ncurses, one static binary per platform.

## Build

```sh
cargo build --release
./target/release/vulide [file.vul]
```

Needs a real terminal on both ends — launch it from a terminal emulator, not an
IDE "Run" panel or a pipe.

Requires a recent stable Rust (edition 2024). The Vulpin interpreter is found via
`vulpin_path` in the config, then `vulpin` / `vulpin.exe` on `PATH`.

## Keys

| | |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+S` / `Ctrl+O` | save (Save As if untitled) / open |
| `Ctrl+N` / `Ctrl+W` | new tab / close tab |
| `Ctrl+PgUp` / `Ctrl+PgDn` | previous / next tab |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | undo / redo |
| `Ctrl+F` | find / replace bar (`^R` replace-one, `Alt+A` replace-all, `Alt+C` case, `Esc` close) |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | indent / dedent |
| autocomplete | `$vars` · functions · `.U/.L/.S/.T/.C` · command hints — `Enter` or `Tab` accepts |
| `F5` | run the current file |
| `F6` | toggle focus editor ↔ output |
| `F2` | file tree — `↑↓` select, `→`/`←` expand/collapse, `Enter` opens, `r` refresh, `.` hidden |
| `F7` | structure outline — `↑↓` select, `Enter` jumps to the line |
| `Ctrl+P` | command palette |
| `Ctrl+T` | theme picker (live preview) |
| `F1` / `Ctrl+H` | full keys card |
| `Ctrl+Q` | quit |

## Features

- **Editor** — rope-backed buffer, grapheme/display-column movement, undo/redo
  with coalescing, selection, auto-indent on Vulpin block openers, bracket
  matching and auto-close.
- **Syntax highlighting** — a hand-written Vulpin scanner matching
  `Vulpin/src/parser.c` (includes `O` FOR, the real operator set, no string
  escapes), plus keyword/string/comment highlighting for Python, Rust and C
  picked by extension. Unknown extensions render plain. Current grammar shows in
  the status bar.
- **Themes** — a 40-role theme system, 6 bundled themes, live-preview picker.
  Config at `~/.config/vulide/config.toml`.
- **Autocomplete** — pops as you type: `$name` → variables and user functions
  (with an `fn(a, b)` signature), `.` → the string methods, a lone command char →
  a one-line reminder.
- **Find / replace** — incremental, highlights every match, wraps, one-undo-step
  replace-all. Docks below the editor.
- **File tree** (`F2`) — a lazily-expanded directory view in the left column,
  rooted at the open file's folder (or the working dir). `Enter` / click opens a
  file in a tab or toggles a folder. Stacks above the outline when both are on.
- **Structure outline** (`F7`) — functions, loops, conditionals, switch/try
  blocks, labels, jumps, returns, indented by nesting; tolerant of half-typed
  code. `Enter` or click jumps the editor there.
- **Undefined-variable lint** — Vulpin reads an undefined `$name` as `None`
  *silently*. Every such reference is underlined and counted in the status bar.
- **Tabs**, a **command palette**, and a **run console** (`F5`) that streams
  stdout/stderr with line-buffered stdin.
- **Mouse layer** — all optional: run button, draggable splitter, tab
  click/close, click-to-focus, click-away-to-dismiss.
- Sets the **terminal window title** to `VulIDE — <file>` (`•` while unsaved).

## Packaging

`packaging/` has no-sudo, no-Docker build scripts for a Linux x86-64 AppImage, a
static Linux ARM64 tarball, and a Windows zip (cross-compiled with `zig`). See
the scripts for the toolchain.

## Status

v1 (`v0.1.0`) is complete — code editor, tabs, Vulpin syntax, run console, and the
algorithm/structure viewer. Post-v1 work on this branch: terminal title, file
tree, session restore, multi-language highlighting, soft word-wrap (palette ›
Word Wrap; Up/Down still move by logical line). Still open: modal editing.
